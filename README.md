## Project Overview
DataKarya is built with the aim to provide an **interactive and visual learning environment** for those diving into the world of machine learning, AI, and data science. The project is focused on **making complex algorithms more accessible** by visually explaining how they operate, making it easier for learners to grasp the concepts.

With **DataKarya**, users can:
- Explore key machine learning algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Decision Trees**, and more through **interactive visualizations**.
- **Track progress** with an XP-based leveling system that encourages continuous learning.
- **Access valuable learning resources** including cheat sheets, datasets, and recommended books.

## Features
- **Interactive Algorithm Visualizations**: Learn how machine learning algorithms work by interacting with visual representations. Each algorithm's behavior is dynamically illustrated, helping users understand important concepts like data fitting, overfitting, and decision boundaries.
- **Learning Resources**: Access downloadable cheat sheets, books, datasets, and code snippets. These resources aim to help users deepen their knowledge and gain hands-on experience with various algorithms.
- **Progress Tracker and Gamification**: As users explore algorithms and complete tasks, they earn XP points, which unlock new levels and encourage engagement with the content.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The platform has been designed to ensure a **seamless and intuitive** learning experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimal Setup**: The platform can be run directly from the browser by opening the `index.html` file, with no server required.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the platform and providing a clean, easy-to-navigate UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the visual elements and ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- **JavaScript**: For the interactivity of the visualizations and handling user interactions.
- **Python, R, JS, and C++ libraries**: Algorithms' codes used for reference, though the platform operates mostly on the frontend.
- **Visualizations Libraries**: Various JavaScript libraries (such as **TensorFlow.js**) for rendering the algorithm animations and dynamic graphs.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icons are used for a clean and consistent visual style.

## Installation
To set up **DataKarya** on your local machine:
1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zuikre/datakarya.git
````

2. **Navigate to the folder** containing the `index.html` file:

```bash
   cd datakarya
```

3. **Open `index.html` in your preferred browser**. No server or database setup is required, as the platform is fully static and can run directly from your local file system.

   For local development or customization, simply edit the files directly.

## Usage

Once the `index.html` file is opened in the browser, you'll be able to:

* **Explore algorithm visualizations**: Click on different algorithms to view interactive animations that demonstrate their functionality and behavior.
* **Track progress**: As you explore algorithms and complete small tasks, you will earn XP points. Level up to unlock more content and features.
* **Access learning resources**: Navigate through the **Resources section** to download cheat sheets, access recommended books, and explore code repositories or Kaggle datasets.

### Example

To visualize an algorithm:

1. Navigate to the **Algorithms** tab on the platform.
2. Choose an algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression) and interact with the graph to see how it fits data points.
3. Earn XP points as you engage with the algorithm details, answering the quizzes to level up in the path section.
